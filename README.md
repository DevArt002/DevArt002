### I build complex, high-performance applications for the web, with a focus on interactive systems and real-time data. My recent work has centered on digital twin platforms, where I helped shape browser-based design tools and improved rendering and application performance at scale. I enjoy solving deep performance challenges, refining architecture in evolving systems, and turning ambitious product ideas into reliable production software.
